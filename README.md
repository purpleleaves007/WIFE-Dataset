## WiFE: WiFi and Vision based Intelligent Facial-Gesture Emotion Recognition

This is the description project of the WIFE dataset proposed in Paper â€œWiFE: WiFi and Vision based Intelligent Facial-Gesture Emotion Recognition". If you want to obtain the dataset, please visit link:https://cougarmailcollin-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/mmarlen1_cougarmail_collin_edu/Ej6wbgvaAHdOl8inP5x8D-cBfbtHFdDBVni6tX9vXMoqFA?e=VHr3yU.

This paper is the first one to leverage WiFi and vision for the facial expression and body gesture bi-modal emotion recognition. Also, we build the first bi-modal WiFi-Vision Emotion data set, and we provide this dataset for free for researchers for research purposes. This data set cannot be used for commercial purposes.

WiFE has '7 emotions' (i.e. Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad and Surprise), '35 templates' (5 templates are selected for each emotion). Ten volunteers (7 male and 3 female, whose ages range from 23 to 25) repeat each template five times. Finally, '1750 video clips and the corresponding CSI sequences' are collected. Each video clip has a frame rate of 30Hz and a resolution of 720p. For video data, we provide the original video and the cropped video containing only the blocks of the facial expressions, as the file is too large, please contact us if you need the original videos. The packet rate used for collecting CSI data is 500 packets/second, and the CSI file contains data of 90 subcarriers of 3 receiving antennas. For CSI in WiFE, we provide raw data (the suffix is .dat) and cropped data, which only contains emotion-related actions (the suffix is .mat).
